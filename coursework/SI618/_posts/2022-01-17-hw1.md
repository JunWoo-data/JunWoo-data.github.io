**Topics: Data manipulation, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)**

--- 

**Background**

This homework assignment focuses on the analysis of biometric data and exercise performance.

Your main task in this assignment is to explore the data *using the data
manipulation methods we covered in class* as well as those in the assigned readings.  You may need to consult pandas documentation, Stack Overflow, or other online resources.  


A total of 100 points is available in this homework assignment, consisting of:
- 80 points for completing the specific homework questions. More comprehensive 
answers will tend to gain more points.
- 10 points for the overall quality of spelling, grammar, punctuation, and style of written responses  (see [Strunk & White](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L0P7xJwjUGBvyb49mL3dw1Bt7hzRTiTl/view) for detailed specifications).
- 10 points for creating code that conforms to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines.  You should review those guidelines before proceding with the assignment.


**Download the data from:** 
https://www.kaggle.com/kukuroo3/body-performance-data



```python
MY_UNIQNAME = 'yjwoo' # please fill in your uniqname
```

**Answer the following questions.**    
Points for each question are shown below.

For each question, you should
1. Write code using Python and pandas that can help you answer the following questions, and
2. Explain your answers in plain English. You should use complete sentences that would be understood by an educated professional who is not necessarily a data scientist (like a product manager).  When we ask for an explanation of your answer, we are interested in your interpretation of the analyses that you produce.  With the exception of Question 1a, we are not interested in a description of the steps you took to arrive at your answer.

## <span style="color:magenta"> Q1: 5 pt(total):</span>
### Q1a (2pt): Write out the steps you need to follow in order to describe the dataset, in terms of size, number of rows, and number of columns.



1. Import necessary libraries
1. Read csv files and save it to a pandas dataframe
1. Use shape attribute of pandas to describe the dataset, in terms of size, number of rows, and number of columns

### Q1b (3pt): Write and execute the code that will do the steps you identified in Part (a) of this question.


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
```


```python
df_bodyPerformance = pd.read_csv("bodyPerformance.csv")
```


```python
df_bodyPerformance.shape
```




    (13393, 12)



Our dataset has 13393 rows and 12 columns. 

## <span style="color:magenta">Q2: 5 pt:</span>
Without using pd.DataFrame.describe(), report the median age, height, and weight for people in the data. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.  Be sure to indicate units for each variable in your write-up.


```python
print("Median of age:", round(df_bodyPerformance['age'].median()))
print("Median of height:", round(df_bodyPerformance['height_cm'].median()), "cm")
print("Median of weight:", round(df_bodyPerformance['weight_kg'].median()), "kg")
```

    Median of age: 32
    Median of height: 169 cm
    Median of weight: 67 kg


- The median age for people in the data is 32.
- The median age for people in the data is 169cm.
- The median age for people in the data is 67kg.

## <span style="color:magenta">Q3: 5 pt: </span>
Look for any anomalous data points.  For example, are there cases where diastolic blood pressure is higher than systolic blood pressure (which is physiologically impossible)?  Do you notice any other anomalies?


```python
df_bodyPerformance.describe()
```

When our heart beats, it squeezes and pushes blood through our arteries to the rest of our body. This force creates pressure on those blood vessels, and that's our systolic blood pressure. Also, the diastolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. Usually systolic is higher than diastolic and it is very rare case that diastolic is higher than systolic. Most of the participants had higher systolic than diastolic, and only 4 had higher diastolic.

Blood pressure is reported as two numbers: diastolic (the lower number) and systolic (the higher number).  So, for example, if a person has a diastolic measurement of 80 and a systolic measurement of 120, the person's blood pressure would be reported as 120/80.

Blood pressure measurements fall into several categories:

Normal blood pressure. Your blood pressure is normal if it's below 120/80 mm Hg.

Elevated blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is a systolic pressure ranging from 120 to 129 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure below (not above) 80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure tends to get worse over time unless steps are taken to control blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure may also be called prehypertension.

Stage 1 hypertension. Stage 1 hypertension is a systolic pressure ranging from 130 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure ranging from 80 to 89 mm Hg.

Stage 2 hypertension. More-severe hypertension, stage 2 hypertension is a systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.

Hypertensive crisis. A blood pressure measurement higher than 180/120 mm Hg is an emergency situation that requires urgent medical care. If you get this result when you take your blood pressure at home, wait five minutes and retest. If your blood pressure is still this high, contact your doctor immediately. If you also have chest pain, vision problems, numbness or weakness, breathing difficulty, or any other signs and symptoms of a stroke or heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency medical number.

Report the number of people in each of those categories.

Calculate each person's Body Mass Index (BMI).  With the metric system, the formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Since height is commonly measured in centimeters, an alternate calculation formula, dividing the weight in kilograms by the height in centimeters squared, and then multiplying the result by 10,000, can be used. (https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/growthcharts/training/bmiage/page5_1.html)

Create two histograms of BMI: one for gender F and one for gender M.  Describe similarites and differences of the two histograms.


```python
df_bodyPerformance["BMI"] = (df_bodyPerformance["weight_kg"] / np.square(df_bodyPerformance["height_cm"])) * 10000

Above histogram shows two histograms of BMI for female and male participants. The two histograms are similar in that they are roughly normally distributed. Male BMIs are normally distributed centered on an average BMI of 24, and female BMIs are normally distributed centered on an average BMI of 22. The male BMI distribution is a little more bell shaped, and the female BMI distribution is slightly right-skewed. This is because the number of male participants is 8,467, which is twice as many as the number of female participants, 4926. Both male and female BMIs ranges are similar. Male BMI ranges from a minimum BMI of 11 to a maximum BMI of 40, and female BMI ranges from a minimum BMI of 11 to a maximum BMI of 43.

Of the six columns, most have a higher average for male participants. Male participants have higher mean of height(cm), weight(kg), gripforce, and sit-up counts than female participants. On the other hand, in the case of body fat(%) and sit and bend forward(cm), female participants have higher mean than male participants. The average difference between male and female participants in gripforce and weight was the largest, about 18 and 17kg, respectively. On the other hand, in sit and bend forward, the average difference between male and female participants was the smallest, about 6cm.

## <span style="color:magenta">Q9: 15 pt: </span>
Take a look at gripForce (a measure of strength), "sit and bend forward" (a measure of flexibility), and "sit-ups count" (a measures of strength and endurance of the abdominals and hip-flexor muscles).  For each of those measures, calculate their z-scores (i.e. subtract the mean of the variable from each observation, then divide by the standard deviation of that score).  Create an overall fitness score by adding the z-scores for each of those variables together, then use `pd.qcut()` (not `pd.cut()`) to assign them to five categories ranging from lowest score to highest score.  Report the number of individuals in each of the resulting categories.


```python
column_list = ["gripForce", "sit and bend forward_cm", "sit-ups counts"]

for c in column_list:
    df_bodyPerformance[c + "_z"] = (df_bodyPerformance[c] - df_bodyPerformance[c].mean()) / np.std(df_bodyPerformance[c]) 
```


```python
df_bodyPerformance["fitness_z_score"] = df_bodyPerformance["gripForce_z"] + df_bodyPerformance["sit and bend forward_cm_z"] + df_bodyPerformance["sit-ups counts_z"]
```


```python
df_bodyPerformance.head()
```

New column fitness_z_score ranges between minimum -8.5 and maximum 24. We assign them to five categories(1 ~ 5) ranging from lowest score to highest score. 
- category 1: category 1 ranges from about -8.5 to about -1.73
- category 2: category 2 ranges from about -1.73 to about -0.38
- category 3: category 3 ranges from about -0.38 to about 0.64
- category 4: category 4 ranges from about 0.64 to about 1.77
- category 5: category 5 ranges from about 1.77 to about 24

Since qcut splits all participants into 5 groups of the same size, the number of people in each group is approximately 2679 equally.
