- Ranking is the most important information in our club activities.
- Figure 2 is information about the rankings previously shown in the Excel sheet. It's simple information, but it looks visually complicated because there are only numbers.
- Also, it was difficult to show various information related to rankings, such as cumulative wins/losses, win rates, and recent results.

*Figure 2: Ranking point information from the previous Excel sheet*

- So, while looking for ranking & standing tables of various sports, I made a ranking table by referring to the following two sports.

*Reference 1: Soccer league standing table*

- Figure 3 is the ranking table of the newly created dashboard. It shows more information intuitively and easily than the existing Excel sheet.
- It shows information such as cumulative win/draw/loss, win rate, change in win rate, cumulative number of games, and recent records that were not able to be shown in the existing Excel sheet.
- It is intuitively easy to understand by expressing the increase and decrease information compared to last week in color.
- Information is intuitive, simple and easy to understand.

- In addition to the ranking table, the ranking point trajectory information in Figure 4 was also provided to help understand the ranking trend of each player more easily.
