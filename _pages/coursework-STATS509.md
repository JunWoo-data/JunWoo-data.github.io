- **Programming language**: R
- **Topics**: 
    - **EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Boxplots, Histogram, KDE(Kernel Density Estimation), QQ plot, TKDE(Transformation Kernel Density Estimation)
    - **Modeling univariate distribution**: Location, scale, and shape families, Skewness and kurtosis, MLE(Maximum Likelihood Estimation), Goodness-of-fit tests, Tail inference
    - **Multivariate modeling**: Multivariate Normal and t-distribution, Regression, Copula
    - **Time series**: ARIMA(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, Model selection and forecasting
    - **Portfolio theory**: Markowitz variance-optimal portfolios, CAPM, Fama-French factor model
    - **Non-linear time series**: ARCH, GARCH, ARMA-GARCH
    - **Risk quantification**: Measure of risk, Estimation of VaR and Expected Shortfall, Resampling and backtesting
