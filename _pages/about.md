### About me
I am a talented data scientist with a strong combination of practical experience and theoretical knowledge. I am seeking an opportunity to make a powerful impact on an organizationâ€™s capabilities and performance, while
continuing to accelerate professional development.    
      
I have a deep understanding in the areas of statistics, economics, and mathematics. Possess key insights into end-to-end data pipelines, with the ability to transform, process, and optimize data delivery. I also have a demonstrated skill and expertise applying complex statistical and machine learning models to resolve business challenges of all complexities.
        
Some of the core strengths I bring to the table include:
- Data Mining & Analysis
- Project Management
- Enterprise Solutions
- Analytics Platforms
- Machine Learning
- Predictive Modeling
- Dashboard Development
- Regression & Multivariate Analysis
- Dimension Reduction Analysis
- Survival Analysis
- Nonparametric Statistics
- Time Series Analysis
- Cross-Functional Collaboration
- Complex Problem-Solving

I am interested in thinking about what information users will need and visualizing it by analyzing related data through statistical and machine learning models.
